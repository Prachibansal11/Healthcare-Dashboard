This project uses **Power BI** to analyze healthcare data from 5 hospitals and 1000 patients. The analysis focuses on **patient demographics**, **treatment outcomes**, and **hospital costs** to generate actionable insights that improve both patient care and operational efficiency.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

Using Power BI, we developed an interactive dashboard that reveals:

- Opportunities to **optimize treatment costs** 💰
- Insights to **tailor care based on patient age and gender** 🧑‍⚕️👵
- Trends that support **data-driven decision-making** for better outcomes ✅

---

## 🧰 Tools and Skills Used

- 📊 **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards and data visualization  
- 🐍 **Python (for prep)** – Data formatting & transformation (if applicable)  
- 📈 **Statistical Analysis** – Identifying patterns and trends  
- 🧠 **Healthcare Domain Expertise** – Interpreting insights in context

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

This project utilizes two Excel sheets:

### 👨‍⚕️ Patient Information

- `Patient` – Unique ID  
- `PatientName` – Full name  
- `Age`, `Gender`, `Bloodtype`  
- `Diagnosis`, `Treatment`, `Full Prescription Details`  
- `AdmissionDate`, `DischargeDate`  
- `TotalBill` – Total cost of hospital stay  

### 🏥 Hospital & Staff Information

- `Hospital` – Name of the hospital  
- `DoctorName`, `RoomNumber`, `DailyCost`  
- `Treatment`, `RecoveryRating`  

---

## 💼 Business Question

**"How can the hospital optimize treatment costs while maintaining or improving patient recovery outcomes across different age groups and treatment types?"**

---

## 🔍 Key Insights & Recommendations

### 1️⃣ Cost Analysis Across Treatments

- **Observation**: Surgery has the **highest average cost** per patient.  
- 💡 **Recommendation**: Promote alternatives like **physical therapy or medication** for suitable cases.

---

### 2️⃣ Treatment Costs vs Recovery Rating

- **Observation**: Surgery doesn't always lead to the best recovery outcomes.  
- 💡 **Recommendation**: Emphasize **cost-effective treatments** like **counseling**, which show better recovery ratings at lower cost.

---

### 3️⃣ Age Group-Based Recovery Analysis

- **Observation**: Seniors show the **highest variability** in recovery outcomes.  
- 💡 **Recommendation**: Tailor treatment plans using **age-segmented insights** to improve efficiency.

---

### 4️⃣ Trends in Patient Admissions

- **Observation**: Peak admissions correlate with certain diagnoses.  
- 💡 **Recommendation**: Use trends to **optimize resource allocation** during high-demand periods.

---

## ✅ Recommended Next Steps

### 🔴 High Priority

#### 1. Optimize Treatment Plans  
- Focus on **high-recovery, low-cost** treatments  
- Replace expensive low-performing procedures with effective alternatives  

#### 2. Tailor Plans for Seniors  
- Use age-specific recovery data  
- Implement **custom interventions** for better outcomes in senior patients

---

### 🟠 Medium Priority

#### 3. Manage Resource Allocation  
- Analyze admission trends 📆  
- Prepare staffing, beds, and supplies during peak months 🏥

---

### 🟢 Low Priority

#### 4. Explore Non-Surgical Alternatives  
- Pilot programs for **physical therapy** & **medication-based treatments**  
- Track outcomes and adjust protocols accordingly

---

## 📌 Conclusion

This Power BI project enables hospitals to make **evidence-based decisions** that:

- Improve **patient care quality** 👩‍⚕️  
- Reduce **unnecessary costs** 💸  
- Enhance **operational efficiency** 📈  

By focusing on data-driven improvements, healthcare teams can deliver more personalized, effective, and affordable care to their patients.
